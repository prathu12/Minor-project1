    <p text-align="text-center"><b>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631,
        to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal,
        who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, G
        auhara Begum.[12][13] Construction started in 1632,[14] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648,
        while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.
        The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story

        height="400px" width="400px">
    <p><b>Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast
        from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.
        The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250.
        Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m)
        high chariot with immense wheels and horses,
        all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular
        the large shikara tower over the sanctuary;
        at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains.
        The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes,
        including erotic kama and mithuna scenes.
        Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga
        architecture.<b>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Dwarkadheesh_temple.jpg" height="400px" width="400px">
    <p>
        <b>The Dwarkadhish temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally spelled Dwarakadheesh, is a Hindu temple
        dedicated to Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish, or 'King of Dwarka'.
        The temple is located at Dwarka city of Gujarat, India, which is one of the destinations of Char Dham, a Hindu
        pilgrimage circuit.
        The main shrine of the five-storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir.
        Archaeological findings suggest the original temple was built in 200 BCE at the earliest.
        The temple was rebuilt and enlarged in the 15th-16th century.
        According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha,
        over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place).
        The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th
        century,[citation needed] in the Māru-Gurjara style.</b>

    <h4 id="prathu">Shivneri Fort</h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/MainEntranceGate.jpg" height="400px" width="400px">
    <p>
       <b> Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri.
        This fort was mainly used to guard the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan.
        The place passed on to the Bahmani Sultanate after the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century and
        it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in the 16th century.
        In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhonsle, the grandfather of Shivaji Bhosale, was enabled by the Ahmadnagar
        Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan.
        Shivaji Maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood
        there.
        Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Shivaji was named. The English
        traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible.
        According to his accounts, the fort was well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years. The fort came
        under the control of the British Rule in 1820 after the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
        In 2021, it was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage sites as part of "Serial Nomination of
        Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra"</b>

    <p>
        <b>Raigad is a hill fort situated in Mahad, Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the strongest
        fortresses on the Deccan Plateau. It was previously known as Rairee or Rairy fort.[1]

        Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Chhatrapati Shivaji and the Chief Engineer was Hiroji
        Indulkar. Chhatrapati Shivaji made it his capital in 1674 upon being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom,
        which later developed into the Maratha Empire, eventually covering much of western and central India.[2]

        The fort rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above base level and 1,356 m (4,449 ft) above sea level in the Sahyadri
        mountain range. There are approximately 1,737 steps leading to the fort. The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway,
        reaches 400 m (1,300 ft) height and 750 m (2,460 ft) in length, and allows visitors to reach the fort from the
        ground in only four minutes.<b>[citatio</b>

        height="400px" width="400px">
    <p>
        <b>Ellora Caves comprise 34 temples and monasteries that were cut into a 2 km (1.2 mi) long basalt cliff between
        the 7th and 11th centuries. As they were built by followers of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, they illustrate
        religious tolerance of the period when they were constructed. The largest temple is the Kailasa Temple
        (pictured), that is elaborately decorated with sculptures and paintings.
        There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which
        are open to public.[3] These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves
        30–34) caves.[4][5] Each group represents deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as
        monasteries of each respective religion.[4] They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious
        harmony that existed in ancient India.[2][6]

        All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty (r. 753-982 CE), which constructed part of
        the Hindu and Buddhist caves and the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by
        royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.[3][7]

        Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims,[5] the site's location on an ancient South
        Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region.[8]

        Ellora Caves are situated 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-west of Sambhaji Nagar, and about 300 kilometres (190
        miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major
        tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a are a protected monument under the
        Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).</b>

        <b>The Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra, and also known as Agra's Red Fort. Built by the Mughal
        emperor Akbar in 1565 and completed in 1573, it served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal Dynasty
        until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the "Lal-Qila" or
        "Qila-i-Akbari".[1] Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas.
        In 1983, the Agra fort was life inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[2] It is about 2.5 km northwest of
        its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.

        Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However, in the
        15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi
        (AD 1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing fort at Agra.
        After the first battle of Panipat (AD 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In AD 1530, Humayun was
        crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (AD 1556–1605). Later this
        fort was under the rule of Jats of Bharatpur for 13 years.</b>

    <p>
        <b>Sindhudurg district was established on 1 May 1981.

        The word 'Konkan' is of Indian origin and considerable antiquity, though the origin of the name has never been
        definitively explained. The seven kingdoms of the Konkan of mythology are mentioned in the History of Kashmir
        and are said to have included nearly the whole west coast of India. The Pandavas are said to have passed through
        this region in the 13th year of their exile and to have settled in this area for some time. The Raja of this
        region, Veerat Ray, accompanied them in the war at Kurukshetra with the Kauravas.[3]

        In the second century A.D., the Maurya Empire annexed the Konkan coast. In the middle of the sixth century,
        kings of the Maurya and Nala dynasties appear to have ruled in the Konkan. The district of Ratnagiri was under
        the Silahars, and the capital of their kingdom was probably Goa. Later it may have been relocated to a more
        central place in the vicinity of Ratnagiri or Kharepatan. Chandrapur was one of the most ancient towns in
        Konkan, probably founded by Chandraditya, son of the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II.[3]

        The 16th century saw the advent and rise of Portuguese power on the west coast of India and Sindhudurg was not
        immune. The sultan lost his hold on the district in 1675 with the rise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and the
        district became part of the Maratha Empire. Marathas continued to rule the district till 1817, when the conflict
        between the British and the Peshwas concluded and the whole of Konkan was transferred to the British.[3]</b>
